# GEA2022
Repository for Game Engine Architecture fall 2022

The code should be compatible with Qt >= 6.3.0 and the MSVC2019 64bit - compiler, and with CONFIG += c++17 set in the .pro-file.

Make your own branch for you to work in. Name your branch something with your real name, so we see whose branch it is.

You can begin by putting in the best you have from the 3D-programming course, as a starting point for this course.

In your own branch you can play around and make whatever changes you want. You can also make several branches if you want to test out something, and then merge it into your main branch if successful. 

You should **NOT** change the folder name of the project. It has to be named **GEA2022**.

**DO NOT PUSH ANY CHANGES INTO THE MAIN BRANCH!!!**.
